# **Movie Library**

Movie Library is an IOS application where a user can store any movie they want to watch in there app. Also, the user will have the options to look at what current movies are showing on theatres, and will have access to any reviews people may have written about the movie, and will see which actors were a part of the film.

**Features**
Below are the following features of my app:

1) User can add a new movie they have recently watched to the app, with an image which can be chosen from their phone's photo library. While doing this, the user can enter information like the name of the movie, the year it was released, the date it was added, language of film, director name, and the rating you give this movie. You can also see the custam app screen logo that I made and in the launchscreen as well.

2) Once there are more than two movies added then the user has the ability to go to a separate settings page where specific parts of each movie row can be filtered to certain features like ordering the movies in alphabetical order, showing movies from lowest to highest or highest to lowest, showing directors in alphabetical, and languages of each movie in alphabetical order.

3) In this app I've also mad a custom Tab bar in the bottom of the screen. The first tab bar item is the home screen. Now, we are moving on to the next tab bar item, the current films showing in theatres, most popular films, and films that are currently trending. All the movie information, like the name of the movie, language of the movie, the overview of each movie, the dates the movie was released and the ratings for each were fetched through tb's Movie Database API. All information was parsed to fit this application.

4) For the last tab bar item I decided to make a custom carousel.
